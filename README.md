# Sonic 2 Nick Arcade Disassembly
A disassembly of the Nick Arcade prototype of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for the Genesis/Mega Drive; it was originally dumped in 2006 by drx on Hidden Palace after a community fund, and is quite unfinished, having many leftovers from Sonic 1 (and [many other interesting things](https://tcrf.net/Proto:Sonic_the_Hedgehog_2_(Genesis)/Nick_Arcade_Prototype)) and only four of the levels, one of which was scrapped.
